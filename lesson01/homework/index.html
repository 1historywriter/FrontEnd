    <h2>Physicist</h2>

    <p>With his theory of relativity, published in 1905, Einstein revolutionized physics and became a world-famous natural scientist. In 1921 he received the Nobel Prize. During his academic work at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, his political commitment grew. He supports the German League for Human Rights, advocates the Zionist idea and becomes a staunch opponent of the National Socialists. They speak of the “Judaization of physics” and burn his writings. In 1933, Einstein did not return to Germany from a lecture tour in the USA and went to the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton. After 1945 he opposed the use of the atomic bomb and campaigned tirelessly for freedom of expression and global peace.</p>

    <p>- 1879   March 14th: Albert Einstein is born in Ulm as the son of the businessman Hermann Einstein and his wife Pauline (née Koch).<p>

    <p>- 1896   He begins studying mathematics and physics as a teacher at the Zurich University of Technology after being rejected there the previous year.<p>

    <p>- 1900   Diploma as a specialist teacher for mathematics and physics.<p>

    <p>- 1902-1909   Technical preliminary examiner at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property (Patent Office) in Bern.<p>

    <p>- 1905   Publications in the "Annals of Physics" on quantum theory and the theory of relativity: He expands Max Planck's quantum theory to include the hypothesis of light quanta. By founding the "special theory of relativity" he initiated the transition to 20th century science. Shortly afterwards he provides an addendum to the theory of relativity with the formula E=mc². The energy of a body is the product of its mass and the square of the speed of light.
        His theories quickly established themselves in science.<p>

    <p>- 1907   Habilitation at the University of Bern after rejecting it the previous year.</p>

    <p>- 1909   Einstein receives an associate professorship in theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.</p>

    <p>- 1911   As full professor at the University of Prague.</p>

    <p>- 1912   He works at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where, in addition to his research, he is required to take courses on theoretical physics.</p>

    <p>- 1914   April 1st: Einstein receives an appointment to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. He can now devote himself exclusively to his research as he has no teaching obligations.</p>

    <p>- 1915   October: Einstein formulates the "General Theory of Relativity", which replaces previously valid physical explanations.</p>

    <p>from 1920 Einstein was met with hostility in Germany because of his research and his Jewish origins.
        After the murder of Walther Rathenau (1922), the Hitler Putsch (1923) and the great electoral success of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) in the Reichstag elections (1932), he feared anti-Semitic attacks on his person and left Berlin for a while.</p>
    
    <p>- 1921   August 24th: The so-called Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelsohn is inaugurated in Potsdam. With the help of this tower telescope, the theory of relativity will be tested empirically.
        Einstein receives the Nobel Prize in Physics for introducing the concept of light quanta and his work in the field of theoretical physics.
        His research revolutionized the fundamentals of physics: a new understanding of the nature of space and time as well as a new view of gravity emerged.</p>

    <p>1925-1927 He continues to work on quantum theory.</p>

    <p>- 1933   30. Januar: Am Tag der Machtübernahme durch die NSDAP befindet sich Einstein in Pasadena. Er protestiert gegen die Menschenrechtsverletzungen in Deutschland und legt sein Amt an der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften nieder, noch bevor die Nationalsozialisten ihn ausschließen können.
        Einstein siedelt in die USA über, wo er in Princeton (New Jersey) eine neue Anstellung am Institute for Advanced Studies erhält.</p>
    
    <p>- 1939   August 2nd: Despite his fundamental pacifism, he also signs a request to the American President to push ahead with the construction of the atomic bomb. He fears the advance of German nuclear research and its military use.
        1945</p>
    
    <p>- 1945   August 6th and 9th: After the US Air Force dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Einstein founded the “Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists”. As president of the committee, he is committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.</p>

    <p>- 1955   *April 18: Albert Einstein dies in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>
